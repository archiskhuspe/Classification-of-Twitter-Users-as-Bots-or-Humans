# Socio.ML: Identification of Social Accountsâ€™ Responses Using Machine Learning Techniques

Automated Twitter accounts controlled by bot software are Twitter bots, also known as zombies. Liking tweets and following other users, large scale tweet and retweet content for specific goals- are the tasks performed by bots.

One of the important problems in social media platforms like Twitter is the large number of social bots which are controlled by automated agents, generally used for malicious activities. These include directing more visitors to certain websites which can be considered as spam, influence a community on a specific topic, spread misinformation, recruit people to illegal organizations, manipulate people for stock market actions, and blackmail people to spread their private information by the power of these accounts. 

In this project, we explore the bot response to an unexpected political event, describe the overall presence of political bots on Twitter, and design and employ a model to identify them based on their user profile alone. We are going to use Botcheck to find hashtags that are popular with political bots on Twitter. 

A python-based web application is developed for classifying between accounts managed by humans and bots. Attributes such as binary values were selected during feature engineering to indicate the presence of account name, follow count, description and status.

From the four machine learning algorithms that were implemented, the decision tree classifier gave the best accuracy score of 0.8785, which was then selected for further binary classification tasks.
